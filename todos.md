# Todos:

- Familiarize with Treesitter Text objects

# The problem with Github projects approach is...

- Does not cover technical exploration.
    - Well, we could just create new issues / custom libraries to do that.

# We need to accelerate the "Realization" process

- Acknowledge and realize things faster will accelerate our speed of work.

## But how do you realize things in the first place?

### The realization process:

- Realization is the result of changing beliefs.

### The beliefs changing process:

Factors that contributes to changing beliefs:

- New information
- Letting go of old beliefs / old beliefs become obsolete, no longer needed
- Changing of situation, personal needs

- For example: one of the beliefs I have is `I don't want to create a framework for Neovim components`
- Question: if my needs change, will my beliefs change too?
- Answer: Yes

- Question: Then, why do I need to create framework to create Neovim components?

# Realization vs Engagement
- Interesting topic to cover, don't miss out.
